A server-side web API consists of one or more publicly exposed endpoints to a defined requestâ€“response message system, typically expressed in JSON or XML by means of an HTTP-based web server.

## Description 
This web app uses GitHub's API to search for open source projects with open issues and pull requests. The processing takes place on a web server; in a nutshell, when something is on the server-side, we basically mean that it is or will be executed in the server or a remote machine.
Server side programming is that which performs all the task in the server only.  Using the browser's Fetch API to communicate with a server, the JavaScript retrieves and displays repositories and their open issue counts when a user searches for them.

#### Github API:
The github API is a RESTFul server-side API that provides URLs, or endpoints, where a developer can make requests for GitHub user and repository data to use in their own application. Simply enter the user in the search bar, and the app fetches the user's repositories using the api Url.
